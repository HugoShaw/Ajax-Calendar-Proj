## Calendar

## Creative Portion 
We created a button called Today that brings the user back to the current month. We also allow the user to write descriptions when creating events. Also, when the number of events exceeds the space available on the calendar, we show a message with how many additional events are present. When the user clicks on the "x more events" message, a popup appears with the rest of the events. Lastly, we created categories that the user can use to differentiate events. Events from different categories show up as different colors. The user is also able to add new categories. 

## Usage 
In order to create a new event, click on white space on the day you wish to create the event. To edit events, click on an existing event. A sample user is (username: user1, password: 1234). To see events, check on the category of events, you would like to see. If all categories are unchecked, you will see no events on the calendar.
